Preprocessing :
Build all 84 scales.
Build all 36 chords ( major minor and diminished, later on we can add more chords).
Analyze the input and build 4 chord objects from it.
Filter out all of the irrelevant scales that do not fit all 4 chords.
Take the chord progression and filter out every scale that does not fit the progression.
I think
evaluation: we analyse every 5-10 bars? --> concept
how? --> according to how many matches with chord...
how many variation it made...?

input: chord progression,
ex-input) 50,G,C,CM,EM,F#
AI needs to do evaluation

action: {notes} X {_,__,___,____}
one action: (CD,__) --> CD
(CD,__) --> CD
(C$,__) --> C$
(C$E,___) --> C$E
(FE,__) --> FE

gui --> change .txt to .wav file
.txt-> parse it -> A:144hz,....
it plays .txt file.
final output: .wav file
